    --
    -- Much like @Tactics@, computations can be run and threaded
    -- through the use of 'runS' and 'bindS', and first-order constructors
    -- may use 'pureS'. In addition, 'liftS' may be used to
    -- lift actions of the final monad.
    --
    -- Unlike @Tactics@, the final return value within a `Strategic`
    -- must be a monadic value of the target monad
    -- with the functorial state wrapped inside of it.

-- State semantics between effects that are interpreted in terms of the final monad
-- depend on the final monad. I.e. if the final monad is a monad transformer stack,
-- then state semantics will depend on the order monad transformers are stacked.
