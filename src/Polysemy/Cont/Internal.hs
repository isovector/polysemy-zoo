  KingoftheHomeless: OK, so let's discuss how this works.
  The idea here is to instead of providing a monadic computation
  to the call of 'callCC' that simply short-circuits everything like
  'ContT' does, we fake that behaviour by instead providing an
  exception to 'callCC', and then try to 'catch' that exception
  on the continuation. If the exception is caught, then we run the
  continuation again. This way, we can get abortive continuations
  without having to scope over a result type variable, avoiding
  the problem that 'runContUnsafe' has, and making it possible
  to weave other effects through without breaking everything.

  Even with that solution, weaving effects through have more problems
  of their own; namely, if we simply lower a
  'forall s. ContT s (Sem r) a' to 'Sem r a', then we effectively
  delimit all higher-order computations. This is bad, because
  if a reified continuation produced within
  the higher-order computation escapes from it,
  then nothing can catch the underlying backtrack exception
  once it is thrown.

  The solution to this is anothor kludge: when weaving other effects through,
  we instead use 'runContViaFreshInCWeave'; this makes use 'ContFreshState'
  as its functorial state, which stores /handlers/ for backtrack exceptions.
  'runContViaFreshInCWeave', in addition to 'catch'ing exceptions on the continuation
  it is given, /also/ returns the handler it uses for the 'catch'.
  This handler is then used by 'runContViaFresh' to catch exceptions on the
  continuation /it/ gets, but can't provide to the higher-order computation.

  I'm astonished that this even remotely works, but it does have some rather
  weird behaviour I haven't completely figured out yet; especially in the
  interaction with effects local in regards to the 'Cont'.

  I'm reasonably happy with how 'runContViaFreshInC' looks;
  I'm a lot less happy with 'runContViaFreshInCWeave', I just kinda threw
  it haphazardly. I figure most weirdness stem from issues in
  'runContViaFreshInCWeave', so I need to think it through some more.
