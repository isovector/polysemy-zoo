--
--   * A way to convert @z@ (which is typically @'Sem' r@)to @m@ by

--
--   * An inspector that is able to view some value within the

-- | An effect for embedding higher-order effects in the final target monad
-- of the effect stack.
--
-- This is very useful for writing interpreters that interpret higher-order
-- effects in terms of the final monad.
--
-- 'Final' is slightly weaker, but using it is otherwise more preferable
-- than using a provided lowering function (a la 'Polysemy.Async.lowerAsync'):
--
--   * Interpreters using 'Final' may be run and composed like any other
--     interpreter, unlike @lower-@ interpreters which need to be
--     composed using '.@' or '.@@'.
--
--   * Multiple return-value changing interpreters using 'Final' may be
--     composed together without issue. It's very difficult to
--     compose 'Polysemy.Error.lowerError' with itself, unlike
--     'Polysemy.Final.Error.errorToIOFinal'.
--
--   * Initialization work of @lower-@ interpreters may be duplicated
--     when composed together with '.@'. @-'Final'@ interpreters avoid
--     this issue altogether, as long as the initialization work is performed
--     outside of a 'interpretH' / 'Polysemy.Final.interpretFinal'.
--
--   * Instead of having access to a natural transformation
--     @forall x. 'Sem' r x -> m x@, @'Final' m@ provides a
--     distribution through the effectful state:
--     @forall x. f ('Sem' r x) -> m (f x)@,
--     together with the initial state @f ()@, and an @'Inspector' f@.
--     (See 'ThroughWeavingToFinal')
--     This is powerful enough for most purposes.
--
-- /Beware/: 'Final' actions are interpreted as actions of the final monad,
-- and the effectful state visible to
-- 'withWeavingToFinal' \/ 'Polysemy.Final.withStrategicToFinal'
-- \/ 'Polysemy.Final.interpretFinal'
-- is that of /all interpreters run in order to produce the final monad/.
--
-- This means that any interpreter built using 'Final' will /not/
-- respect local/global state semantics based on the order of
-- interpreters run. You should signal interpreters that make use of
-- 'Final' by adding a @-'Final'@ suffix to the names of these.
--
-- State semantics of effects that are /not/
-- interpreted in terms of the final monad will always
-- appear local to effects that are interpreted in terms of the final monad.
--
-- State semantics between effects that are interpreted in terms of the final monad
-- depend on the final monad. For example, if the final monad is a monad transformer
-- stack, then state semantics will depend on the order monad transformers are stacked.

-- | Like 'interpretFinal' specialized to 'IO', but also tries very hard
-- to preserve state semantics dependant on the order interpreters are run,
-- adressing the primary issue with 'Final'.
--
-- Semantically, interpreters written using this behave very much as
-- though they were written using 'withLowerToIO'.
-- However, this does not need to spawn an interpreter thread, making
-- it more efficient (but not any more safe.)
--
-- 'interpretFinalGlobal' operates under the assumption that any effectful
-- state which can't be inspected using 'Polysemy.Inspector' can't contain any
-- values. For example, the effectful state for 'Polysemy.runError' is
-- @'Either' e a@. The inspector for this effectful state only fails if the
-- effectful state is a @'Left'@ value, which therefore doesn't contain any
-- values of @a@.
--
-- The assumption holds true for all interpreters featured in polysemy,
-- and is presumably always true for any properly implemented interpreter.
-- 'interpretFinalGlobal' may throw an exception if it is used together with an
-- interpreter that uses 'Polysemy.Internal.Union.weave' improperly.
