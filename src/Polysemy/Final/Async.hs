-- | Run an 'Async' effect through final 'IO'
--
-- This can be used as an alternative to 'runAsyncInIO'.
--
-- /Beware/: Effects that aren't interpreted in terms of 'IO'
-- will have local state semantics in regards to 'Async' effects
-- interpreted this way. See 'interpretFinal'.
--
-- Notably, unlike 'runAsync', this is not consistent with
-- 'Polysemy.State.State' unless 'Polysemy.State.runStateInIORef' is used.
-- State that seems like it should be threaded globally throughout the `Async`
-- /will not be./
--
-- Prefer 'runAsync' unless it's unsafe or inefficient in the context of your
-- application.
